The issue is ""what can we do to reduce gun deaths in our country"". No one is trying to take your guns away. In the last eight years how many guns has Obama seized?  Zero. Not a single one. I am stunned and saddened that this fear mongering which has proven to be a lie - is still effective today... 
To blame gun violence on a lack of morals or a breakdown of society in America without evidence is absurd. Look at any country in Europe. Compared to them, we are a deeply religious, conservative country. Yet they have a fraction of then the gun violence we have. 
We can keep our guns and reduce gun deaths. To think Americans are stupid, immorale and not capable of problem solving is shocking. I believe in the greatness of this country and its people. And  I'm convinced reason will conquer fear as we move into the future.",False,True

"I was thinking that too. As a White guy who ""enjoys"" white privilege, I am not in a position to understand Black Lives Matter like a person of color might. But let me try to explain why I think Sanders has been focused on economic justice instead of racial or legal justice.
Some assumptions: Blacks have been inordinately impacted by the growing disparity of wealth. White group have proposed that the problem is that Black people lack a work ethic. They do not see the unequal funding of schools, lack of infrastructure, quality housing, and attraction to gangs as a way out of a future of despair.  Added to this are the Right wing establishment like the Heritage Foundation, CATO Institute and Limbaugh that churn out fictions called ""white guilt"" and ""politically correct""  to ignore this economic based discrimination. Sanders would say you cannot begin to address prejudice until the injustice of the economic system is fixed.  So he seems insensitive to the Black Lives Matter.",True,False

He has succeeded in business so he cannot be as stupid and clueless as much of the media portrays him.  I suspect that he is actually very smart and has determined to act so as to connect with the populous.  If elected, I am guessing that he would promote a more reasoned agenda.

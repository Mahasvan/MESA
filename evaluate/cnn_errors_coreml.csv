Standing for the singing of the national anthem denotes acceptance of a form of patriotism that celebrates inequality and gross injustice not to mention mindless conformity.

At 6-foot-2, the height that he has long given profile writers, ... [b]y government guidelines, Trump is obese. In a weasel move to avoid that classification, Trump now says he is 6-foot-3, which makes him merely overweight. How he grew an inch, at the age of 70, is a story that has escaped his hagiographers at Fox.

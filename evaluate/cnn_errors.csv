"with 5 months to go anything can / will happen, Trump and Clinton could be out of the picture, if Clinton is gone the Left have a shoe-in with Sanders, if Trump is out that fractured bunch is done. If they're both standing in Nov. it comes down to turnout of which both sides will suffer voters sitting it out vs the countering anti / never voters. Trump's riled up mob of angry town folk, a vocal minority, are more motivated but winnowing as his caveman shtick wears thin vs the weak candidacy of Clinton that will grow slightly with fears of Trump. If Trump is still his own worst enemy and Clinton can up the charm factor as she has in the past, plus be the stable mind in the mix then she'll secure voters despite the grey areas that are fogging things up. Then there's the one sided electoral map, currently all the left have to do is take Virginia and they win. While Trump is surly a jerk, his followers are the real problem, he merely tore the scab off and exposed the 'ugly American' voter.",0,1

Second, I'm frankly embarrassed by the consistent bitterness and xenophobia of my hometown towards any new transplants.  I have lived in a number of other cities, and everywhere else people were friendly, welcoming, and wanted to know what you had to say and offer.  But not PDX!

Same as you probably wouldn't dig the company of Amish farmers.

The native Portland white is for the most part a mellow guy who doesn't like confrontation or violence and feels uncomfortable, even disgusted, by garish displays of macho posturing. Knowing that what we regard as civility is considered “pussy” by African Americans who come here with Big Bad Cali/East Coast attitudes simply adds insult to injury.

I don't think anyone likes bankruptcy but to make a provision in the law requiring oil companies to post a $250,000 surety bond to make sure unsecured creditors receive payment if a company goes bankrupt makes no sense and is clearly unfair, why not all companies not just oil companies, if the Bankruptcy court even allows it and they won't!

Back then, sovereignty ruled the day and if someone was overstepping their bounds, they got what they were asking for and it was okay. Today, the cities are nothing more than nested victims paying for someone else to kill and die for them, when the paid for killers are around. It's very dangerous in the cities.

The difference is that back then, APD, AST,  and the citizens not only rejected the unsavory element coming into this State, but actively sent them back unto which location they had come from.

And that is a sad thing, whence the populace has changed said ideology from Alaskan independent thinking and action, unto the ideology of Portland, Seattle, or San Francisco, hence our own mayor, rather than removing themselves, or we removing them, from our own area, because of said freedom and independence seeking ideology.

Even if the corporations managed to pass on 2/3 of the tax, we would still be getting 3 billion dollars in additional revenue for a consumption tax of 2 billion. I'll take that. The structure of this tax is rational and productive. An important question is whether we are going to go on tolerating the erratic and wasteful tax structure we have now, where programs and departments ands agencies are slashed and then re-funded in ways that are wasteful and inefficient and lead to poor performance because revenues are so irregular.

China has a new middle class they did not have three decades ago.

I'm  in favor of seeing the PFD restructured but not until SB21 is revised, the ""new oil"" clause is struck and the subsidies  permanently repealed.

By now you must know that restructuring the PFD was just one component of the balanced set of proposals presented to the legislature by Governor Walker back in January. Taking the PFD restructuring in isolation is a cheap ploy by the GOP supermajority to disguise the fact that they refused to consider and vote on the entirety of the plan. The GOP controlled Senate voted to do the PFD restructuring while refusing to consider the repeal of an equal amount in subsidies to the oil industry proposed by the Governor. The legislature refused to do the one job it is constitutionally mandated to do out of cowardice. The governor put forth a complete plan at great political cost. Refusing to even hold votes on the budget ideas set forth by the Governor then setting up this misleading propaganda campaign suggesting that Walker is stealing half your dividend is such a transparent lack of taking personal responsibility for not doing the damn job you were elected to do.

"This ""rule"" is new to me.  Where did it come from?  Was it the 11th Commandment?  Or the 28th amendment of the US Constitution?  Or perhaps it is the 1st rule of Ms. Fawcett's personal and totally subjective version of ""Rules for Radicals""?  Or perhaps Ms. Fawcett's ""logic"" is similar to that of former SCOTUS Justice Potter Stewart who, when asked how he defined pornography, said ""I know it when I see it"".  I'm so confused!:)   

But can you blame me?  After all, since the terms ""fuck you"" and ""fuck you assholes"" have, within my lifetime, been transformed from perhaps the worst things we could say to each other to now totally defanged and democratized parts of everyday speech, how can it be that vertically extending one's middle finger should be ""saved"" for life-threatening experiences--as if that was still the case even 50 years ago?

"""Pretty much everything LfS2 writes is either drivel or meaningless.""   Sounds pretty personal to me.

I've heard 'drivel' from folks that are professional writers.    The future is unknown and a change of events can alter our expectations very quickly.    Did living through 9/10  prepare us for 9/11?   I think not, yet it was an event that shaped at least 16 years of our foreign policy.  We can't change the past or forecast the future perfectly.    This is an opinion site and not a crystal ball.  There's plenty of room for interesting speculation.

"Pay your fair share of taxes for what, so that all of the out of state businesses can send the profits made here in this state somewhere else.

Since we have no IRS up here to help get the oil money back into the system, paying government employees provided a way. Also the government providing money for projects that unions worked on was another way and essentially made union employees into government employees. Since Alaska really has no exports, oil was what provided the income, 95% of the budget that paid everybody and probably 90% went to businesses that shipped the profits out of state ultimately.

"You are partly correct. Reagan began his 1980 campaign in Philadelphia, Mississippi. This was where the KKK and some law enforcement officers murdered three people who were registering blacks to vote and buried them in an earthen dam. Bush Senior's campaign did use the Willie Horton ads as anti-black dog-whistles to energize their campaign. But the first Republican to use a ""southern strategy""  to move Dixiecrats from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party was Richard Nixon in 1968.

That only leads us up to today. Drumpf has refused to reject the support of David Duke, former grand wizard of the KKK. He also has refused to reject the support of American neo-Nazis...in fact, one of his campaign tweets was a retweet of a poster from a neo-Nazi site. If you lie down with dogs...or neo-Nazis or the KKK...then you will wind up with fleas or become known as a bigot and a racist. And I am not even mentioning his attacks on almost all Mexicans as rapists and thieves.",0,1

"The Murkowski Administration negotiated a deal with the producers for a gas line.   A bunch of weenies at DNR, some with close ties to TransCanada got it killed.   Some of those same weenies hooked up with Palin and convinced her to abandon her stated commitment to a Tidewater route, a commitment that got her Gov. Hickel's endorsement, and instead endorse a Canadian route and give TransCanada a half-billion dollars to develop it, for which Alaska got ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, but a lot of people made a lot of money.   Now we're on another crazy train with Walker's obsession with a gas line that the produces won't invest in, but will be happy to sell the suckers in Alaska the gas that nobody wants.",0,1

"""People do come here for the freebies, no doubt about that."" You really should have some doubt, when you don't know what you're talking about. There are no more ""freebies"" here than anywhere else, and what there is is mostly services not shelter, which is what most homeless people need the most. There is no national network telling homeless people where the best places are with the most benefits. Most of our homeless are homegrown. Ones who do come here  usually do so because they have a local connection.

Churches provide some shelter, never enough, for families with children. It would be difficult for a rest stop camp to include children. More rest stops are needed for all homeless subgroups. The main thing that is limiting them is finding a place to put them, since neighborhoods oppose siting them. And therefore end up with much worse unorganized illegal camps. People cannot seem to get that through their thick heads. There is a lot of ignorance and stupidity out there.",0,1
"Ms. Gegonos - You ask how Ms. Moore justifies writing this article without giving Munoz's side of the story?  Balderdash!!  Munoz gave her side in writing the two letters -- neither of which gave one word of sympathy to the child victims. Andf as I've said before, her excuses were limp as a wet noodle.  And for the other commenters here  who question if Ms. Moore would write the same if the legislator was a ""lib"" or ""Democrat"" - you're so far off the mark you should be ashamed. This is not a political/party issue.   Bottom line - Munoz has a clear history of  supporter sexual abusers of children. She should step down because she is not fit to serve the people of Alaska. She needs counseling, but likely is delusional and is sitting there wondering ""what's all the fuss about.""  Pathetic.",0,1

Ted: This Board Of Game [BOG] only represents hunters and trappers. Not a single member on the BOG represents the large majority of  Alaskans who have  interests in wildlife, other than just killing the predators. This scandalous lack of representation is, I believe, the reason for the crazy situation at Denali National Park, where park wildlife is lured out of the Park with bait, and gunned down till the world's most-viewed and longest-studied wolf pack has been exterminated. The idea that hunters and trappers can take care of the interests of all Alaskans is patently ridiculous.

Trying to link Powell for doing the same as Hillary in operating a pay to play scam between Foundations and the State Dept. is utter dumb IMO.  Unless you can produce some hard factual evidence?

"So Walker had the money in the Constitutional Budget Reserve to pay the tax credits this year.  But instead he vetoed the payment and now wants someone else to pay the bill.  And then he hopes to pay back that someone the amount owed ... PLUS INTEREST.  If at the end of the year this deal started, then the state would owe a principal of $700,000,000 plus interest.   If the interest rate was 5%, then the state would owe the bond holder an additional $35 million a year, every year.

The good thing about this is that is shows the ballpark cost of Walker being an idiot and vetoing the payment of tax credits.  His stupidity will may likely cost the state $35 million a year, for the length of the bond issue.  If the bond is 10 years, we're talking about a bad decision by Walker that costs Alaska around $350 million.  Walker is a very expensive fool.",0,1

He stated that the biggest failing of our schools is that they do not teach obedience to God.  Without a proper religious education, he argued American students had no moral foundation to build an education upon.

President Obama has tried from the beginning of his Presidency to make our nation healthy again only to face one obstructionist roadblock after another set forth by the Republicans; John Boehner did it as the Speaker of the House and now Mitch McConnell is doing it as the Senate Majority Leader.

"""The cheapest and most certain way to reduce murder is the death penalty for murderers.""  

I dispute this assertion vigorously.  Simple reason.  Most murders are committed by people who only offend once.  Yes, there are some serial killers, but most murders are from rage or circumstance that does not recur.  Other crimes are like this as well.  Commission of most crimes is by first time offenders.  The notion that killing offenders will reduce crime is largely without factual basis - it just feels good.

Teaching that human life can be forfeit on the false premise that it reduces crime, in my opinion, creates the very atmosphere wherein individuals are prone to take life.  Teach the taking of life and individuals will learn.  

Emotionally, i support killing those who resort to premeditated murder.  Rationally, I believe that each time we collectively kill we likely motivate and engender multiple killings between individuals who are simply applying what we collectively teach.",1,0

"Wait a minute here.  Natural Gas has a very high percentage of methane, the heart of energy requirements.  A fact is that we have become totally dependent on electricity.  this is true of Americans, Mexicans, Chinese, Brazilians, Indians and the list goes on.  The poorer countries (anyone other than the USA) relies on producing electricity the cheapest way possible, which means burning coal.  So those who oppose natural gas as a fuel source are either supporting coal or condemning the supply of electricity.  Another indisputable fact is pollution travels the world free of source liability.  This means that emissions created in any one country travel to other countries, resulting in problems of an international issue.  So, we should head towards renewables, but that will make electricity too expensive for the average family, at least until technology gives us a better solution.  Until then, we are obligated to ensure we minimize pollution, which means replacing coal with natural gas.",1,0

“You want to know what this was really all about?” he asked with the bluntness of a man who, after public disgrace and a stretch in federal prison, had little left to protect. “The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”

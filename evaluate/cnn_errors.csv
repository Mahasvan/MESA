"with 5 months to go anything can / will happen, Trump and Clinton could be out of the picture, if Clinton is gone the Left have a shoe-in with Sanders, if Trump is out that fractured bunch is done. If they're both standing in Nov. it comes down to turnout of which both sides will suffer voters sitting it out vs the countering anti / never voters. Trump's riled up mob of angry town folk, a vocal minority, are more motivated but winnowing as his caveman shtick wears thin vs the weak candidacy of Clinton that will grow slightly with fears of Trump. If Trump is still his own worst enemy and Clinton can up the charm factor as she has in the past, plus be the stable mind in the mix then she'll secure voters despite the grey areas that are fogging things up. Then there's the one sided electoral map, currently all the left have to do is take Virginia and they win. While Trump is surly a jerk, his followers are the real problem, he merely tore the scab off and exposed the 'ugly American' voter.",0,1

We, as Americans, have an alcohol problem, regardless of our own personal drinking because how do you escape the drunk, on a packed plane, seated next to you?

This is the same ""authority"" that has been trying to kill the very successful Anchorage (Weekend) Market since its inception in the early 1990s, blaming it for their declining business, rather than facing up to the fact that the falling sales of many downtown businesses is really due to the diminishing interest among tourists and locals alike for the cheap, cookie-cutter made-in-China junk peddled by many of them.",0,1

Even if the corporations managed to pass on 2/3 of the tax, we would still be getting 3 billion dollars in additional revenue for a consumption tax of 2 billion. I'll take that. The structure of this tax is rational and productive. An important question is whether we are going to go on tolerating the erratic and wasteful tax structure we have now, where programs and departments ands agencies are slashed and then re-funded in ways that are wasteful and inefficient and lead to poor performance because revenues are so irregular.

I'm  in favor of seeing the PFD restructured but not until SB21 is revised, the ""new oil"" clause is struck and the subsidies  permanently repealed.

By now you must know that restructuring the PFD was just one component of the balanced set of proposals presented to the legislature by Governor Walker back in January.

The GOP controlled Senate voted to do the PFD restructuring while refusing to consider the repeal of an equal amount in subsidies to the oil industry proposed by the Governor. The legislature refused to do the one job it is constitutionally mandated to do out of cowardice. The governor put forth a complete plan at great political cost.

Ted: This Board Of Game [BOG] only represents hunters and trappers.

"So Walker had the money in the Constitutional Budget Reserve to pay the tax credits this year.  But instead he vetoed the payment and now wants someone else to pay the bill.  And then he hopes to pay back that someone the amount owed ... PLUS INTEREST.  If at the end of the year this deal started, then the state would owe a principal of $700,000,000 plus interest.   If the interest rate was 5%, then the state would owe the bond holder an additional $35 million a year, every year.

The good thing about this is that is shows the ballpark cost of Walker being an idiot and vetoing the payment of tax credits.  His stupidity will may likely cost the state $35 million a year, for the length of the bond issue.  If the bond is 10 years, we're talking about a bad decision by Walker that costs Alaska around $350 million.  Walker is a very expensive fool.",0,1

He was right.

About 2/3 into the school year the principal could no longer make excuses, and sent Junior packing. He was allowed to resign so a blemish didn't go on his record, and this way he could go to another school district and cheat more kids out of a basic education.

You don't have to like Bruce - that is your prerogative but at least have your facts straight when you right a stupid article.  He is relevant if he still sells out shows/stadiums - he has continued to release new material and does not just sing older songs save for this tour.   A good percentage of the fans at his shows are nor blue collar.  Writers/poets/song writers have always written about things other than themselves.  Also your childhood shapes who you are and he grew up low middle class so he can relate to many of these things.  Just because you end up being rich doesn't mean those feelings leave you.,1,0

By the way, I don't believe for a second that you are graciously keeping up these comments you have deemed ""racist"" just to show you're not a censor. No, dear. You left those comments up because your new comment system hasn't been generating as many comments as you would like.

Media buys are not working this year for the Republican fat cats.

"Martin - I just wanted to let you know that this article really encapsulates all of the reasons I moved away from Portland last year. I don't care if you are serious or not, it doesn't really matter.  I can not imagine how miserable it must make other people to be around someone like you.

He has succeeded in business so he cannot be as stupid and clueless as much of the media portrays him.  I suspect that he is actually very smart and has determined to act so as to connect with the populous.  If elected, I am guessing that he would promote a more reasoned agenda.  I remain happy that Trump has blown away the media enforced sterile code of behavior that prior prevailed.  He is right to attack the media talking heads.  They are shallow minded demagogues.",1,0

Now, here is the scary and I do mean scary part...his supporters hear him say these bizarre things BUT don't see the harm in it, or look the other way and still vote for him. Really? That's the mentality of many voters...""I don't care if he calls other leaders stupid or spends time at rally's talking about himself and his successful TV show, I think he is going to fix things and I support him."" If he is elected I fear many Americans will be spending a lot of time on their knees (even you) ... praying the country can get through 4 years without his running it off further  into the ditch.",1,0

High density planning has caused poverty, homelessness to explode, and yet this ignorant clown claims ""“deprives moderate income people of the security and wealth-building benefits of owning a home.” All too true. But is that really what is primarily happening here in Eugene? I think not."" This is the new Jim Crow. Just like racists didn't want ""negro's"" owning homes because they didn't like that growth, liberal bigotry is doing the same to all they disagree with. If you're rich you get a home here, everyone else gets crammed in like rats in apartment buildings. What these fools fail to grasp is when you price the working poor into an affordable home they rise to entry level middle class as the mortgage grows wealth through equity that shortens the gap between rich and poor.  We used to have a strong middle class through affordable housing until liberal dementia, a social disease void of intelligence outlawed this housing.",1,0

"I hear you supporting free speech -if it matches your own opinion.   You want to have your own harsh criticisms in the name of 'free speech', but you are quick to label dissent as evil in uncompromising terms, (like parasites)

======
It's hypocrisy that liberals have had to deal with as well.   What do you do with a Nazi, a violent student movement, a white supremacist group that hasn't killed.       Rightly of wrong, liberalism, (look at the ACLU), has allowed even the most repulsive of comments to be made.

You are wrong in labeling all liberals as intolerant of conservative, authoritarian, even fascist speech.    Liberals, like conservatives, CAN be ultra defensive of their view points.   But real liberalism allows dissent to be voiced.  

Liberals and Conservatives  who use stereotyping to describe friends and foe, are showing their insecurity about accepting real free speech - more accurately, free thought.

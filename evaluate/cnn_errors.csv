0,"I'd never defend anyone being inconsiderate or reckless, regardless of the circumstance (and note I haven't done that here either).  However, I do see degrees here that make these very different.  Cyclists in the road rightly fear for their lives in the face of an aggressive, reckless, or careless driver; pedestrians on a MUP have no reason for any similar fear at the hands of an aggressive, reckless, or careless cyclist.  The two are incomparable.

So while I see where you're coming from, accusing them of hypocrisy, I hope you can see where that may not be the slam-dunk you imagine.  If they're railing against a life-and-death situation and then putting someone else into a not-at-all life-threatening situation, that's not quite the same thing.

If it did bother them,  not acknowledging their feelings about the incident may seem like a short term solution, but in the long run, it will only make matters worse.

Also, you cannot tell us WHY the other parent declined to be interviewed. Sure, in wealthy communities there are lots of parents trying to manipulate the coaches. But also a black family will often try to keep their name out of the news on a complaint because their child still has to attend school and be in the social milieu where other kids may ostracize them for getting the coach in trouble.  

I hope the school district does the right thing and gets rid of this coach. And uses it as an example for other coaches of how not to invoke race with our young people.",1,0

He described himself as a cultural warrior and was a member of various secret societies. (He died while on a junket with one of those secret societies.) Such bias is inappropriate for a Justice, but he was blind to criticism.

His fans liked to call him brilliant, but his lack of consistency and extremely illogical and flawed, if angry, dissents tell another story. He was consistent in looking out for the interests of the wealthy and powerful, but that was his only consistency.

Studying guns will not stop this violence and will in fact distract us from focusing on the real problem: the people who perpetrate this violence and their motives. Recently, the motives have been crystal clear: furthering the cause of radical Islam through murder and spreading fear. The reason ""nothing changes"" is because the response of our President and the political leftists he leads has been to use these tragedies to further their cause to disarm the American public, leaving us even more vulnerable, rather than vigorously pursuing, capturing or killing those radical Islamists responsible before they do this again.

First graph: given the total population of people in Multnomah County Jails, 20% are black. (8% are Hispanic, etc.)

Second graph: given the total population of people in Multnomah County Jails that had force used against them by staff (guards, booking officers, what-have-you), 33% of the people are black. If it was proportional you'd expect to also be 20%.

Third graph: given the total population of people in Multnomah County Jails that had a taser used on them, 44% are black. 

If (say) 33% of the total population required force, and of that 33% tasers were used 50% of the time, you'd still expect to see the same ethnic breakdowns as the overall population if there wasn't a racial difference going on: 20% of all taser incidents would involve black inmates.

The kicker is blaming Clinton for not killing Bin Laden but then denying credit to Obama for killing Bin Laden. That was the story Republicans promoted because while Obama ordered the strike, he did not personally shoot the terrorist. And Truman did not drop the A-Bomb ending the war with Japan.

To your point, something I'd like to see is the offence that the inmates are in for and see how that breaks down along racial lines. In other words, are non-white folks in jail for violent crimes more often than white folks? If so that would suggest a correlation between violent crimes and use of force -- people who commit violence are more likely to be targets of force in jail. Then it becomes a question of ""why are non-whites getting convicted for violent crimes disproportionately?"" which then may lead to other questions: arrest rates, propensity to commit types of crimes, etc.

145,"Explain to me this: You are indicted on charges of ""Impeding federal officers from doing their job"", But the media has been allowed to call you a terrorist, an accusation your actions do not even support, and the court has been allowed to treat you like a terrorist, locking you in a 6x6 dark room with no sunlight or artificial light and NO mat or bedding to sleep on even though your actions AND indictment do not support such treatment? Ammon is allowed 1 hour per day out and that has been shortened to 15 minutes multiple times. Thats our justice system at work? Not only is Ammon and the others being held as guilty until proven innocent, but they are being held in conditions that dont even support the charges brought against them. Justice and Liberty for all?",1,0
146,"Wow.  Lots of heated debate here. OK, the road is dangerous.  Would improving it with a boatload of money our state does not have make it safer?  We have a very large percentage of terrible drivers in this state and if I were in charge I would make it far more difficult to get a driving license.  But alas that is another topic.  It seems for less money we could make the road a bit safer.  We just returned from UK and did extensive driving there - they use cameras - when you approach an area with camera surveillance there is a notification sign letting drivers know and if you have a gps in your car it notifies you and posts the speed limit.  We were told the cameras work well and tickets are issued and that it frees up law enforcement for more important issues.    As for another gravel quarry, our state is becoming ever increasingly a tourist destination and the Seward Hwy drive is considered one of the most beautiful in the world.   It is stupidity to add such a eye sore.",0,1

149,"It was not murder.  LaVoy fled, endangered others, and charged the FBI.  The FBI was forced to open fire then.  It was suicide by cop.  La Voy pledged to kill himself before  allowing himself to be arrested.  He did.

The Bundys and their cohorts are criminals.  They stole and damaged property.  They are tax dodgers.  They turned guns on Federal officers and threatened them.

The government bent over back wards to settle this peacefully.  they undercharged them for their crimes.  If a gang had robbed a bank and someone dies in the commission of their crimes, the whole gang is charged with murder-even if the gang weren't the ones to shoot.  That's the law.

I suggest you read the Constitution yourself, and Supreme Court decisions and American History to learn the real meaning of the law and not your distorted uneducated version of it.",1,0
150,"“Will Whiteness History Month make all white people hate themselves? Will white students cry themselves to sleep for the rest of their lives?”

Hahahahahaha. This makes me very happy. The whole idea sounds a little bit ridiculous but it’s bound to spark some real political hostility! Hoorah for PCC.",1,0
151,"When this first went on the ballot, I researched the source of this water and its quantity (posted all that at the time.)  The authorized amount is not going to remove water that isn't going to be replaced by normal sources as it has for the hundreds of years before we arrived here from the Continent of Europe.  That's the science of it; just like there is science for climate change.  You may not believe in either science.

Your complaint thus comes down to corporate hate.   This may be hatred of just Nestle (and they have a bunch of hot buttons - most notably their profit on infant formula in the 3rd world), or maybe any profit-making corporation is part of your demonology, or maybe anything with the word corporation in its name (Corporation for Public Broadcasting?) is a hated thing.

Personally, I agree with metooist that bottled water is 'stupid'.  But it is legal and I have more sympathy for people trying to make a family-wage living than your hatreds or denial of science.",0,1

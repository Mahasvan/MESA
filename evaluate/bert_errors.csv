"Nasty little piece by a person who represents the political party that created the biggest deficits in Alaska history.  It was Republicans who grew the spending unsustainably, year, after year.  It was Republicans who gave away our oil with SB-21.  It was Republicans that refused to diversify the Alaska economy.

So Walker comes into the mess created by Republicans.  What did Republican legislators do in the five months they wasted during the session?  They decided to not fix our broken oil tax structure.  But what they did do is decide to pay out almost $700 million in welfare to Big Oil, per year.  One of the biggest single expenditures in the state budget.

The GOP controlled Senate voted to do the PFD restructuring while refusing to consider the repeal of an equal amount in subsidies to the oil industry proposed by the Governor. The legislature refused to do the one job it is constitutionally mandated to do out of cowardice. The governor put forth a complete plan at great political cost.

No. People are being mislead by terrible journalism.

1. If Russia is not already spying on the secretary of state of their largest geopolitical rival, then they are the stupidest superpower in world history. They don’t need Trump’s “encouragement.”

2. Trump is not “encouraging” Russia to hack into Clinton’s email server. Trump is (correctly) noting that they have almost certainly already hacked it and is encouraging Russia to release what they found.

3. Clinton’s lawyers and aides deleted almost 30,000 emails – and wiped their hard drives – before turning the rest over to investigators. They claimed that these 30,000 were not work-related. However, FBI investigators were able to recover some of the 30,000, and discovered that, yes, some of them were in fact work-related.

4. So that is what Trump is saying: Hopefully, Russia will produce what Clinton’s team deleted.

Thank you, first of all for your racist comment.  It actually does mine own heart good.

I do NOT define, as apparently you do, the demographics of the homeless, but rather state that those agencies that claim to represent, and support their own demographic predispositions, well than, they should go in whole hog, as it were.

That said, Wyatt, I give not unto said organizations that ""claim"" to help those that need it, I give unto those that I deem deserving, within monetary, time, and items, or stuff, as it were, mine own self, so as to help them the most direct way that I can.

I care not a damn about the demographic of the family, I only care that they need, and deserve whatever help that I can give them, so as to further their own desire to be productive members of society.

And THAT, Wyatt, is the difference between mine own self and our Government.

I choose unto who, and where, mine own hard earned money goes unto.

It's a dangerous thing, trying to harness hatred.  He chose an utterly scary and unqualified running mate because of her gender, and pretty much created the Tea Party, which in turn spun out of Republican control.

Now the Republicans find themselves without much of an identity, except as the party of hate and negativity.  Their history is better than that.  I think they can come back from this, but it will be hard work, and they will probably lose this next election unless they can escape Trump.  Maybe changing the primary system to that the west gets to vote too would be a start.",1,0

"No one OWNS land. That is the biggest flaw in modern society, this idea anyone owns land. I know the occupiers were no saints, but the occupiers of a few years ago on the left, which I generally agreed with, had their bad apples too.
Owning land is the main reason for the class division and rising inequality we are seeing exploding today.
I don't think this has much to do with ""white privilege"", unless you want to go further and say the entire founding of the US was white privilege.(all land was acquired through violence at some point in the past) It has more to do with a lack of knowledge of how to change the system, and a growing frustration of many folks in the rural west, much of it justified. Let's not point the finger at rural ranchers until we have walked a mile in their shoes. By the way, that free  range grass fed beef you picked up at New Seasons might have come from one of those ranches.",1,0

"I've watched some of the GOP debates and find it hard to believe that members of the Party haven't condemned the boorish behavior of the candidates.  Trump's comments and actions are perfectly in character.  If forced to describe the man, I'd express my opinion, calling  him a racist, a sexist, an elitist, a homophobe, a xenophobe, a megalomaniac, .... in sum, a nasty, mean-spirited man...  On the positive side, I'd praise him for not being a hypocrit.  He's very willing to display the behaviors I describefor all to see.  (yes, I know expressing such an opinion isn't PC.  However, my opinion is based on his public behavior.  If you find it ""biased"", I'll be happy to provide links to document his actions) 

Should he be nominated and should he be elected President,  the voters will have selected him knowing exactly what they were getting.  The true tragedy is it seems, a significant number of   Americans  think Trump represents their vision of what  ""America"" should be.",1,0

"Not sure homophobia is a good way to describe something I have such an outwardly indifferent attitude towards.  Is the human species intended to pair heterosexually?  In my opinion yes, and I believe God had this intention.  Is the infrequent diversion from this norm bad in and of itself?  F**k if I know! 

The bible does reference it very little and I realize my posts seem very cut and dry.  Beyond the above reasoning I can't say or argue definitively what the role of monogamous homosexual relationships are within the church or what Gods view on them are.  That's why it's just my opinion, not some fact I'm going to use in manipulating others.  I think you are doing a disservice by equating disagreement with intolerance. 

 If I rarely drank your favorite kind of beer would you call me intolerant toward your preference? No, we would say ""huh, we like different things in a way that literally affects nothing"".  I believe a biblical stance on LBGT would have a similar impact to society.",1,0
"Kitzhaber via Hayes was deeply corrupted. It's a shame that he let himself be destroyed in such a way, as his successor Gov. Brown is much, much worse. At least Kitzhaber had the clout to stand up the the public sector unions now and then. Brown is 100% in the pocket of the SEIU extortion machine. The real loser in all of this is our pocketbooks.

The failure to see each other as humans beings and the notion that the ""right"" of one person to not being subjected to seeing what they deem an ""eyesore"" superseding human life in and of itself is a fascinating thing.  It's why people protest suicide barriers on bridges, even though we know they save lives, people get upset about their scenic view being disturbed, it's why people cry for ""men's rights"" as a retort to the notion that a woman's body is her own - because they don't even want to acknowledge that women are equal, it's why people complain that they're tired of hearing about racism without thinking how it must feel to live with it everyday.",1,0

"""I am not saying that transgender people are predators. Not by a long shot. What I am saying is that there are countless deviant men in this world who will pretend to be transgender as a means of gaining access to the people they want to exploit, namely women and children."" 

""There’s no way to make everyone happy in the situation of transgender locker room use. So the priority ought to be finding a way to keep everyone safe. I’d much rather risk hurting a smaller number of people’s feelings by asking transgender people to use a single-occupancy restroom that still offers safety than risk jeopardizing the safety of thousands of women and kids with a policy that gives would-be predators a free pass.""

"You are kidding, right?  I love my dogs, but as soon as they started to lose their dignity, I put them down.  If a domesticated German Shepard lived to 13 years, like, mine did, that's a good, long life.  She was spoiled and loved and we still miss her, but when a dog's time is up, it's up.  Its in her best interest to be put down in dignity.  BTW, I am a city boy that grew up in Philly and now live on the beach in Florida.  I'm not a farmer with livestock to lose.  But, equating very old wolves that kill livestock to shooting a Grandmom, is very, very stupid.  I don't get that comparison at all.",0,1

And if it was a conservative Republican who was president and nominated someone for the Supreme Court I would expect a Democratic Senate to do their duty by holding hearings, and giving due consideration to the nominee, just like the Constitution says they should.  Republicans and Democrats come and go. They are duly elected by the people. Honoring the Constitution and our system of government is what preserves this country and makes it work. Not liberals or conservatives, Democrats or Republicans.  No one party has all of the answers. Stop disrespecting and demonizing the other side.  It's what is killing this country.",0,1

I look out my kitchen window at an oil rig tied to the Homer deep water dock.  It is 400 yards away literally framed in my kitchen window.  100% of the crew on that rig is from Louisiana and surrounding states.  The state of Alaska is paying a large % of the bill for this rig.  A big seismic project is going on near Anchor Point.  Less than 10% of the crew are Alaskans.  The state is paying for this as well.  There is no chance of the state ever breaking even on our investment compared to leaving our money in the bank on either of these projects.  Oil tax credits are a jobs bill for outsiders.  Fire teachers.  Hire outsiders.  Give the oil away for less than free.  This is the way of the Support Industry Alliance and the Corrupt Bastards Club.,0,1
"Gee, sorry ""Wavemaker"", you must be one of the newly elected tax and spenders on the Assembly.  Why so sensitive?  And if you are looking for someone (apparently a ""Republican"") to criticize you'd better look elsewhere.  Yes, there is a fiscal crisis in the State - that does not give the Assembly license to raise Taxes by 7% BEFORE they even know if the State fiscal crisis is going to affect Anchorage.  Juneau is amateur hour and it doesn't matter which party they belong to.  Whatever goes on in Juneau or Anchorage it is un-American to tax one household (those over $300k valuation) and then redistribute that tax to others.  Planning to spend more (as the Assembly has done) in this economic environment is just STUPID, and 8 assembly members voted to do so.",0,1

"The multiple instances of the phrase ""gun violence"" in this editorial is indicative of the failure of the author to understand the cause of the violence being discussed. Guns may be the tool of choice for those doing this kind of violence, but guns are not the cause of it. Studying guns will not stop this violence and will in fact distract us from focusing on the real problem: the people who perpetrate this violence and their motives. Recently, the motives have been crystal clear: furthering the cause of radical Islam through murder and spreading fear. The reason ""nothing changes"" is because the response of our President and the political leftists he leads has been to use these tragedies to further their cause to disarm the American public, leaving us even more vulnerable, rather than vigorously pursuing, capturing or killing those radical Islamists responsible before they do this again. And they will. Editorials like this are foolish and irresponsible responses to radical Islam.",0,1

There is a famous anecdote featuring Winston Churchill and the British politician Bessie Braddock that I think is fictional. Supposedly Braddock encountered an intoxicated Churchill and said “Sir, you are drunk.” He replied: ""And you, Madam, are ugly. But I shall be sober in the morning, and you will still be ugly.""

It can be argued that Sir Winston was the poster boy of British civility, while remaining unafraid to speak the truth even when doing so caused the listener substantial 'discomfort'.

"I love the photo of former governor Palin which accompanies this article and is attributed to AP photographer Evan Vucci. But I bet neither Vucci or Palin see the hidden irony that I do. Notice the BIG ivory polar bear pin Palin is wearing? Well future historians will bear me out but the governors eventual crash and burn began with polar bears. She wrote a puffed up piece for the New York Times defending her administrations lawsuit against the federal government for listing polar bears as being an endangered/threatened species. Federal overreach or some such nonsense. It went to court, at an undisclosed heavy cost to the taxpayers, and the state was humbled by the preponderance of evidence against Palin's very public science opinion. Later Palin would wail about frivolous lawsuits leveled at her. By wearing that pin she shows she still doesn't get it. Still backing junk science.",0,1
"Something has got to give.  It's either going to be giving up part of the dividend or paying income or sales taxes.  I agree that the tax credits are an abomination but  Ms. Drummond is in a state of denial over the inevitable and unavoidable future of having to reinstate some sort of state tax.  NO other state that I'm aware of gives out pfds.   The state or two that I am aware of that doesn't have a sales tax or an income tax are always walking a thin line , battling bankruptcy,  relying on the federal government and letting the states go into a run down slum.  Something has to give,  and some sort of blanket tax for everyone has to be re-instated.  Don't be such a coward Drummond,   if you lose a few votes over it,  oh well  you've already lost votes over the whole legislative session anyway..........",0,1
"Actually, I think part of it is that when a person actually IS the President, instead of just wanting the job, they get the full briefings from the CIA, the NSA, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and all those civilian organizations and then really, really understand that what they say gets people killed, or not killed, or in jail or not in jail or economically destroyed, or not, and so forth.  The interim briefings they get as the candidates aren't the real meal deal.

Then, after they are elected, what they said which got them elected is less important and they do their best with the real world facts they have to deal with.  

I think that there is a reason that a sitting President's hair always seems to turn grey before they are done with their second term.

But, as I said, I'm an idealist and don't really believe that the sitting President is actually in league with Satan.  Stupid, ignorant, poorly advised, clueless, all those things I believe about several previous and current Presidents",0,1

She finally admitted she had no idea the answer, and so I asked her: ""if you do not know what the school budget actually is, how do you know if it is adequately funded or not?"" She wouldn't answer that question, and bailed. I am hard pressed to think of a more incompetent, uneducated fool, to hold office than Piercy.",0,1

Alan:  I've seen nothing in any other news reports about these charges that would indicate that a life sentence is possible.  I believe that this Associates Press news report is thus in error on this point. In fact, other news reports that I have read have indicated that this other charge ( using or carrying a firearm during a crime of violence ) has a 5 year mandatory minimum sentence ( much like the Arson charge the Hammonds were convicted of ), and a 10 year maximum. The Justice Department has determined that the seizure of the refuge was legally a violent act, despite the fact that no one was hurt.

I would expect a 5 year sentence on this charge, just like the Hammonds got. That is probably all that they will get.  And no less, due to the mandatory 5 yr sentence requirement.

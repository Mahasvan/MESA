"The societal element within Anchorage is reverting back unto the early 90's.

The difference is that back then, APD, AST,  and the citizens not only rejected the unsavory element coming into this State, but actively sent them back unto which location they had come from.

That seems to be no longer the case, and the lower 48 west coast ideology has somehow taken over not only the ideology of old time Alaskans, within that we all look out for each other, but unto the allowance of said lower 48 west coast ideology, both within social and political formats.

And that is a sad thing, whence the populace has changed said ideology from Alaskan independent thinking and action, unto the ideology of Portland, Seattle, or San Francisco, hence our own mayor, rather than removing themselves, or we removing them, from our own area, because of said freedom and independence seeking ideology.

Alaskans are not liberal.

I think, fear is the operative word here. As things escalate, fear increases and trust diminishes, leading to more liklihood of “untended” violence. Then, add planned, intentional attacks on the police as we just saw in Dallas, and, understandably, the level of anger increases among officers. On the “flip side”, each questionable shooting of Black men increases the anger among African Americans. Fear…..distrust…..anger…… a recipe for disaster.

The good thing about this is that is shows the ballpark cost of Walker being an idiot and vetoing the payment of tax credits.

You ask us to tolerate your ignorant categorization and smearing of all who are homeless. Until Lane County gets a homeless shelter, there is no constitutional requirement for the homeless to die, or to run away from you. They get to survive, to sleep, to eat, and to do what they need. I suspect you present no solution because you have none. You would prefer to pretend that the homeless are action out children, rather than fellow humans. 

The homeless in any city are fellow human beings, and usually, are local people who just have been precipitated out of the economy.

Goldschmidt's case was totally different.   There was a specific allegation.   There was  a victim that came forward and spoke out.  Goldschmidt himself even gave a public confession of criminal wrongdoing.    That is nothing at all like Kitzhaber's situation, where there are no witnesses that have come forward, and no specific allegations of any wrongdoing have been made.

Some assumptions: Blacks have been inordinately impacted by the growing disparity of wealth. White group have proposed that the problem is that Black people lack a work ethic. They do not see the unequal funding of schools, lack of infrastructure, quality housing, and attraction to gangs as a way out of a future of despair.  Added to this are the Right wing establishment like the Heritage Foundation, CATO Institute and Limbaugh that churn out fictions called ""white guilt"" and ""politically correct""  to ignore this economic based discrimination.

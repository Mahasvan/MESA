 I do find it a bit amusing that you manage to criticize Ms Clinton because she did well in the debate. She was well informed, articulate, poised and very statespersonlike.  Yet, you twist that to be detrimental.  Had she, like Trump, been unprepared, nervous, rude, and ill-at-ease for the entire debate, you would have criticized that.  She did very well, so, instead, you are saying, in essence, ""Clinton did badly because she did so well. She had no business being so well prepared.  She had no business being so poised.""

"As some have posted, probably scud-running under VFR. With the near- total destruction of the aircraft, we'll probably never definitively know exactly what went wrong. But the ADS-B data should show their altitude and track, and we'll know if they filed IFR or not. If they were on an IFR plan, they were way off in altitude, which usually requires at least a 2000' clearance from the highest terrain in the vicinity. If they had an emergency at altitude, they should have had time to at least issue a mayday. But from the photo and reports from the site, it looks as though they flew straight into the mountain at cruise speed.

"Trump's slogan ""Make America Great Again,"" as Mr. Chell points out, clearly insinuates that Trump does not think America is great. Millions of Americans, a majority of voting Americans, in fact, think very differently. The flag means many things to all kinds of Americans. 
Many of the same Trump supporters who suggest that anyone who burns a flag should lose their citizenship sport the flag on their undergarments or cut holes in the flag and wear it under their arm pits. Their patriotism is so overblown as to suggest an inferiority complex. Quiet patriots know America's strength is in its diverse and educated people.
Trump needed the help of a foreign government that spies on the U.S. in order to get elected so his patriotism seems quite self-serving but who but a fool would expect more from a rich guy who avoided service with 5 deferments?

I believe the untested rape kits come from situations where the identities are not really in question and the facts surrounding the incident do not support a rape charge.  As you know sexual intercourse is not illegal.  A rape kit tells whether sexual intercourse has occurred and via DNA the male involved.  But if a DA determines that circumstances do not support rape but rather consensual sex, the rape kit provides no useful information.  Of course, every rape kit where the male is unknown should be processed.  I doubt that the unprocessed kits fall into that category.  Too bad some investigative reporting has not occurred.",1,0

"Okay, unconventional thinking.  For violent rapists (not the he-said she-said variety), I would support surgical removal of male organs rather than long jail sentences.  Armed robbers especially should be given relatively short sentences so that there remains a very substantial margin between shooting and not shooting someone.  If the potential shooter knows that pulling the trigger costs a great deal (in terms of sentence), we win through lives saved. Drugs should be legalized.  The damage to society of locking up so many involved in drugs and engendering disrespect for the law is likely worst than that which would be associated with legalizing drugs .  While it may feel good to lock folks up for long terms, we pay for the good feeling.

Who do you accuse of tolerating violence? City centers across the country are the dumping grounds for the abandoned. They are fellow citizens, many of whom are really decent, lovely people. They just are. 
Personally, when I see letters like this, I have to wonder. Exactly who is the barbarian? You ask us to tolerate your disrespect of those who are at the bottom. You ask us to tolerate your ignorant categorization and smearing of all who are homeless. Until Lane County gets a homeless shelter, there is no constitutional requirement for the homeless to die, or to run away from you. They get to survive, to sleep, to eat, and to do what they need. I suspect you present no solution because you have none. You would prefer to pretend that the homeless are action out children, rather than fellow humans. 

The homeless in any city are fellow human beings, and usually, are local people who just have been precipitated out of the economy.

While it is true that a handful of dense European cities happen to have much lower rates of driving than our less-dense cities, there both a variety of reasons for that and a host of similarly compact dense cities in Europe with similar rates of car addiction as we have to show that there is no correlation.

Why are people riding bikes in Copenhagen and not here? How about the fact that Copenhagen has extensive, automated traffic law enforcement and licenses are difficult and expensive to obtain but easy to lose. Here, we give out licenses like Cracker Jack prizes and do no meaningful traffic law enforcement. They also have extensive high quality public transit that works well for multi-modal trips. That's part of the reason their median trip by bike is less than half a mile. 

Now, why aren't the people of Dublin, Rome and Paris on their bikes? They have density, but not the other features.",1,0

I'm sorry to be out of breath, but somebody belted me in the stomach during that. What happened is a Georgia delegate, at least he had a Georgia delegate sign on, was being hauled out of the hall. We tried to talk to him to see why, who he was, what the situation was, and at that instant the security people, well as you can see, put me on the deck. I didn't do very well.""

I don't care if you are serious or not, it doesn't really matter.  I can not imagine how miserable it must make other people to be around someone like you.

Some assumptions: Blacks have been inordinately impacted by the growing disparity of wealth. White group have proposed that the problem is that Black people lack a work ethic. They do not see the unequal funding of schools, lack of infrastructure, quality housing, and attraction to gangs as a way out of a future of despair.  Added to this are the Right wing establishment like the Heritage Foundation, CATO Institute and Limbaugh that churn out fictions called ""white guilt"" and ""politically correct""  to ignore this economic based discrimination. Sanders would say you cannot begin to address prejudice until the injustice of the economic system is fixed.  So he seems insensitive to the Black Lives Matter.",1,0

"""The cheapest and most certain way to reduce murder is the death penalty for murderers.""  

I dispute this assertion vigorously.  Simple reason.  Most murders are committed by people who only offend once.  Yes, there are some serial killers, but most murders are from rage or circumstance that does not recur.  Other crimes are like this as well.  Commission of most crimes is by first time offenders.  The notion that killing offenders will reduce crime is largely without factual basis - it just feels good.

Teaching that human life can be forfeit on the false premise that it reduces crime, in my opinion, creates the very atmosphere wherein individuals are prone to take life.  Teach the taking of life and individuals will learn.  

Emotionally, i support killing those who resort to premeditated murder.  Rationally, I believe that each time we collectively kill we likely motivate and engender multiple killings between individuals who are simply applying what we collectively teach.",1,0

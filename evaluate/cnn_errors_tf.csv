"Why are you buying into the argument that there is a conspiracy to ban guns? Did I say that? Did Obama say that? Did anybody but the NRA say that? Of course not. The issue is ""what can we do to reduce gun deaths in our country"". No one is trying to take your guns away. In the last eight years how many guns has Obama seized?  Zero. Not a single one. I am stunned and saddened that this fear mongering which has proven to be a lie - is still effective today... 
To blame gun violence on a lack of morals or a breakdown of society in America without evidence is absurd. Look at any country in Europe. Compared to them, we are a deeply religious, conservative country. Yet they have a fraction of then the gun violence we have. 
We can keep our guns and reduce gun deaths. To think Americans are stupid, immorale and not capable of problem solving is shocking. I believe in the greatness of this country and its people. And  I'm convinced reason will conquer fear as we move into the future.",0,1

"4:20  POLITICALLY CORRECT is a phrase used to trivialize criticism of an action.  I often refer to the condemnation Dave Frohnmayer received for using the term ""Oriental"" instead of ""Asian"" in a presentation at the U of O as an example of ""political correctness"" run amok.  My concerns and criticisms of Mr. Trump are of a far more serious nature.  I see him as the most unfit candidate for President in the history of our country.....intellectually unfit, morally unfit and emotionally unfit. Those are hardly concerns over not being ""politically correct.""  

I have suggested Mr. Trump, based on his well documented actions and comments, would likely be clinically diagnosed as a sociopath....a condition far more serious that being ""politically incorrect.""  If the worst thing about Mr. Trump as a candidate for President were his being ""politically incorrect"", I would be tremendously relieved.

""That's not really sustainable,"" said North, adding that Lithia, one of the state's three Fortune 500 companies, might reduce its presence in Oregon if the measure passes.

""Everything is on the table,"" he said.  ""We may have to change our headquarters.""

North said his firm now pays between $3 million and $4 million a year in state taxes, and he calculates that amount would increase to about $35 million. Lithia operates on an after-tax margin of about 2.7 percent, he said, and a sales-based tax of 2.5 percent ""basically takes away all the motivation to do business in Oregon because there is no profit.""

Wyden kept alive the biggest sellout to American sovereignty to the corporate elite that has ever been proposed.

Biases are learned implicitly within cultural contexts. People may develop biases toward or against an individual, an ethnic group, a nation, a religion, a social class, a political party, theoretical paradigms and ideologies within academic domains, or a species.[1] Biased means one-sided, lacking a neutral viewpoint, or not having an open mind. Bias can come in many forms and is related to prejudice and intuition.[2]""

I have little sympathy for those who attempt to manipulate us to achieve political objectives especially when they invoke notions of safety where there is no rational danger.  Can any rational human attribute danger to entry to Deady Hall that is related to the name of the building?",1,0
"Ed is right. Black Lives Matter.  So do gay lives, women's lives and all other lives.  We should not privilege the sensitivities of one subgroup of a group and throw out the rest.

Who gets to ""win"" when a person turns out to be complex? Are we going to rename buildings named after President Kennedy because he called the black gay poet James Baldwin, one of America's greatest writers, ""Martin Luther Queen""?  What happens to Churchill High School after people read the colonial views of Sir Winston the Tory?  Do we erase MLK's name because he plagiarized a paper?  What did Abe Lincoln think of gay rights?  Did Cesar Chavez support abortion?  

Do people really feel ""unsafe"" entering a building named after a person a hundred years dead?  That is not a credible position for an adult to take.  The building has only the spiritual power that we each care to give it.

"This is a complex issue with bits of truth on many sides.  In light of Edwin Coleman's findings, the assertion that black students feel ""unsafe"" in the building, if true, suggests a serious educational flaw exacerbated by today's negative emphasis on wrongs rather than rights (as if victimized groups don't have enough ""real"" issues to worry about).  Ironically, universities (with a few glaring exceptions - see Donald Trump's perversion) are supposedly established to discover and broadcast truth.  From that perspective, it would seem that keeping Deady's name on the hall could provide a valuable spring board for demonstrating how racism can be transformed into tolerance and positive social action - which is just what Deady appears to have done in his lifetime.  If delivered, that lesson could go far toward alleviating black student's concerns about entering the place and help to constructively recast campus dialogues for improving inter-group relations.",1,0

No, the Republicans brought Trump onto themselves.  The left has a rabble fringe, and the right has a rabble fringe.  John McCain was a good candidate, who was very qualified to be our President.

It's a dangerous thing, trying to harness hatred.

Now the Republicans find themselves without much of an identity, except as the party of hate and negativity.  Their history is better than that.

If the potential shooter knows that pulling the trigger costs a great deal (in terms of sentence), we win through lives saved. Drugs should be legalized.  The damage to society of locking up so many involved in drugs and engendering disrespect for the law is likely worst than that which would be associated with legalizing drugs .  While it may feel good to lock folks up for long terms, we pay for the good feeling.

Are you not aware of how our national debt has skyrocketed since 2001?    When George W. Bush took office, the national debt was only $5.7 Trillion dollars.   By the time he left office, it was $10.6 Trillion.   Guess where it is now?   It is now $19.1 Trillion, and still climbing very fast.   Our state governments are another $1.16 Trillion in debt, and local governments another $1.9 Trillion.

I don't disagree that we have a bunch of incompetent people running our country into the ground.

President Obama has tried from the beginning of his Presidency to make our nation healthy again only to face one obstructionist roadblock after another set forth by the Republicans; John Boehner did it as the Speaker of the House and now Mitch McConnell is doing it as the Senate Majority Leader. 

President Obama has nominated a competent judge for the vacancy on the Supreme Court, his age of 63 should not be a factor in determining whether he is qualified for the seat.

At which time a request would be presented in court.  It's important that, with early, effective intervention we're not talking about long term commitment to a State Hospital facility.

Some assumptions: Blacks have been inordinately impacted by the growing disparity of wealth. White group have proposed that the problem is that Black people lack a work ethic. They do not see the unequal funding of schools, lack of infrastructure, quality housing, and attraction to gangs as a way out of a future of despair.  Added to this are the Right wing establishment like the Heritage Foundation, CATO Institute and Limbaugh that churn out fictions called ""white guilt"" and ""politically correct""  to ignore this economic based discrimination.

"""The cheapest and most certain way to reduce murder is the death penalty for murderers.""  

I dispute this assertion vigorously.  Simple reason.  Most murders are committed by people who only offend once.  Yes, there are some serial killers, but most murders are from rage or circumstance that does not recur.  Other crimes are like this as well.  Commission of most crimes is by first time offenders.  The notion that killing offenders will reduce crime is largely without factual basis - it just feels good.

Teaching that human life can be forfeit on the false premise that it reduces crime, in my opinion, creates the very atmosphere wherein individuals are prone to take life.  Teach the taking of life and individuals will learn.  

Emotionally, i support killing those who resort to premeditated murder.  Rationally, I believe that each time we collectively kill we likely motivate and engender multiple killings between individuals who are simply applying what we collectively teach.",1,0
